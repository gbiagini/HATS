# Introduction

HLA Allele To Serotype (HATS) was developed with Perl 5.10 on CentOS 7. The program was developed using the reference sequences based on IPD-IMGT/HLA Database release version 3.38.0.

## Installation
Download HATS directory in a Linux computer


## Usage

```perl

# Create an output directory
mkdir output

# Input file
# Download hla_prot.fasta file from IPD-IMGT/HLA Database. IPD-IMGT/HLA Database release version 3.38.0 must be added at the end of hla_prot.fasta file and saved in input directory
# input/hla_prot.fasta.3.44.0
# An empty file is created to show database version when one of the following commands are executed

hla_prot.fasta.3.52.0

# Generate HLA-A allele to serotype table
./runHlaA.pl

# Generate HLA-B allele to serotype table
./runHlaB.pl

# Generate HLA-C allele to serotype table
./runHlaC.pl

# Generate HLA-DRB1 allele to serotype table
./runDRB1.pl

# Generate HLA-DRB3 allele to serotype table
./runDRB3.pl

# Generate HLA-DRB4 allele to serotype table
./runDRB4.pl

# Generate HLA-DRB5 allele to serotype table
./runDRB5.pl

# Generate HLA-DQB1 allele to serotype table
./runDQB1.pl

# Generate HLA-DQA1 allele to serotype table
./runDQA1.pl

# Generate HLA-DPB1 allele to serotype table
./runDPB1.pl

# Generate HLA-DPA1 allele to serotype table
./runDPA1.pl

# Untruncated HLA allele to serotype table is saved in RESULTS directory
# Truncated two-field HLA allele to serotype table is saved in TWORESULTS directory
